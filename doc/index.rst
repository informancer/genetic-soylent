Welcome to Soylent's documentation!
===================================

Quite a lot of people
who have heard about soylent_
have toyed with the idea of mixing their own.

In my case, 
looking for the optimal mix of components,
with so many components to choose from,
became a ground for fiddling around.

What if I could just put a list of ingredients in a database, 
together with their nutritional values,
and some kind of software could create a mix 
that has the right amount of every nutrient?

This is my attempt at creating such a software.
