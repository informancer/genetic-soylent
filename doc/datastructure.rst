Data Structure
==============

In trhe most basic form,
we have a recipe, 
containing quantities of ingredients.
An ingredient in turn contains certain quantities of nutrients.

In order to avoid creating a new file format,
and to get all the goodies that comes with it,
for example migration scripts,
we will use sqlalchemy to store our data.
